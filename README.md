# Leap-Motion-Project

This is a project created for my Sensor Base Interaction class. It is created in Open Frameworks, and requires a [Leap Motion Sensor](https://www.leapmotion.com/) to play.
It is a simple game where a squid moves around collecting objects and avoiding fish, or attacking the fish with an ink spray.
The leap motion allows the user to control the squid with thier hand, wherever their hand moves it follow. When the users wiggle thier fingers, the ink shoots.

In order to run in Open Frameworks, the ofxLeap addon is needed, as well as a leap device
